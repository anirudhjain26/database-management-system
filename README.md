# Restaurant Management System
A full-stack, comprehensive database management application designed to streamline the operations of a restaurant. This project employs Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and MySQL for efficient, secure, and robust data handling.

## Features
- **Inventory Management**: Track and manage inventory in real-time with automatic updates based on sales and restocks.
- **Menu Management**: Add, update, or remove menu items with ease. The system also keeps track of the number of dishes sold.
- **Employee Management**: Keep track of employee information, hours worked, and salaries.
- **Financial Management**: Automatically calculate total sales, total expenses, and profits.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Used for backend development, the system's business logic is powered by Python.
- **MySQL**: Used for database management, ensuring efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Tkinter**: An open-source Python library used for creating the graphical user interface.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies - Tkinter and mysql-connector-python.
3. Run menu.py to start the application.

## Scripts
- **menu.py**: This script manages the menu of the restaurant, allowing for addition, deletion, and updating of the menu items.
- **inventory.py**: Handles inventory management of the restaurant.
- **employees.py**: Manages the employees' data, including their work hours and salaries.
- **financials.py**: Handles financial calculations including total sales, total expenses, and profits.
